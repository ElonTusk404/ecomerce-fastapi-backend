# FastAPI Online Store

Welcome to my first project using FastAPI! This project is an online store backend that I'm building to learn and experiment with FastAPI and related technologies. The API provides endpoints for managing products, categories, carts, and orders.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and user info endpoints.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, delete products, and manage product attributes and images.
- **Catalog**: Browse products with pagination and category filters.
- **Cart**: Manage user's cart, add, update, and remove items.
- **Order Management**: Create and view orders.
- **Caching**: Using Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
