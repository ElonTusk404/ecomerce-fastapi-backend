# FastAPI Online Store

Welcome to my first project using FastAPI! This project is an online store backend that I'm building to learn and experiment with FastAPI and related technologies. The API provides endpoints for managing products, categories, carts, and orders.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and user info endpoints.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, delete products, and manage product attributes and images.
- **Catalog**: Browse products with pagination and category filters.
- **Cart**: Manage user's cart, add, update, and remove items.
- **Order Management**: Create and view orders.
- **Caching**: Using Redis for caching frequently accessed data.


Technologies Used

	•	FastAPI: For building the API.
	•	SQLAlchemy: For database interactions.
	•	Pydantic: For data validation.
	•	PostgreSQL: As the database.
	•	Redis: For caching.

Future Improvements

	•	Adding more comprehensive tests.
	•	Implementing frontend for the online store.
	•	Enhancing security and adding more features.
	•	Regular updates and improvements to the project.
	•	Adding cryptocurrency payments.
	•	Implementing more accurate product filtering.


Status

This project is in active development.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements. This is a learning project, and I’m open to feedback and collaboration.
